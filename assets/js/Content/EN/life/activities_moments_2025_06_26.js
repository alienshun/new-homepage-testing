      'Before leaving after the exams, I gave the children a small science outreach session on experiments related to air pressure. Unfortunately, I was not fully prepared. There was one hands-on experiment that I eventually decided not to conduct because I was concerned about their safety. As a result, the first half hour went rather smoothly, while the last ten minutes or so became a little messy. Still, it was clear that doing experiments attracted the children’s attention much more than my previous mathematics talk did [facepalm]. I am also grateful to Teacher Zhang for the support and help.'
