Experiences that once felt so heavy and vivid have gradually withdrawn into deeper layers of memory; the lessons I once believed could be passed on with certainty have also revealed their own limits in a new stage of life. This return was therefore not merely an act of nostalgia, but a moment of looking back, somewhere between reunion and estrangement, and sensing anew the distance between who I am now and the past I once inhabited.'
